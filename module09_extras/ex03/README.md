# Smart Pointers

- [Task 0](task0) => Implement a double linked list with shared AND weak ptrs (You can improve the STL variant)
- [Task 1](task1) => Implement an unique_ptr
- [Task 2](task2) => Implement a shared_ptr
- [Task 3](task3) => Implement a weak_ptr

Sidenote: They don't need all the protections as their original implementation!
