To formalize what <redacted> suggested as exercise would be to:
 - Define a class to represent a Matrix
 - Define operators for arithmetic operations, some with overloads (ex: matrix x number, matrix x matrix)
 - Define a print for the matrix (you could also define the << operator for that)
 - Experiment with your class and the operators you defined (printing stuff along the way)
